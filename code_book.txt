Tidy dataset - Human Activity Recognition Using Smart Phones
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this project, the dataset below was reorganized to facilitate further analysis.
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones .

The experiment was carried out in the following manner (taken from the original doc):
" The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age
bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial
angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to
label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets,
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."

1. Dataset
   =======
The dataset includes the following variables that are the mean and standard deviation
variables to the original dataset (detailed in: original/README.txt).
The values in each row are the average value of the recordings in the original datasets
per activity per subject (see the description of the variables below):
 [1,] "tBodyAcc-mean()-X"           "tBodyAcc-std()-X"
 [2,] "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"           "tBodyAcc-std()-Y"
 [3,] "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"           "tBodyAcc-std()-Z"
 [4,] "tGravityAcc-mean()-X"        "tGravityAcc-std()-X"
 [5,] "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y"        "tGravityAcc-std()-Y"
 [6,] "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z"        "tGravityAcc-std()-Z"
 [7,] "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X"       "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X"
 [8,] "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y"       "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y"
 [9,] "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z"       "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z"
[10,] "tBodyGyro-mean()-X"          "tBodyGyro-std()-X"
[11,] "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y"          "tBodyGyro-std()-Y"
[12,] "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z"          "tBodyGyro-std()-Z"
[13,] "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X"      "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X"
[14,] "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y"      "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y"
[15,] "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z"      "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z"
[16,] "tBodyAccMag-mean()"          "tBodyAccMag-std()"
[17,] "tGravityAccMag-mean()"       "tGravityAccMag-std()"
[18,] "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()"      "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()"
[19,] "tBodyGyroMag-mean()"         "tBodyGyroMag-std()"
[20,] "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()"     "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
[21,] "fBodyAcc-mean()-X"           "fBodyAcc-std()-X"
[22,] "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y"           "fBodyAcc-std()-Y"
[23,] "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z"           "fBodyAcc-std()-Z"
[24,] "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X"       "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X"
[25,] "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y"       "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y"
[26,] "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z"       "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z"
[27,] "fBodyGyro-mean()-X"          "fBodyGyro-std()-X"
[28,] "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y"          "fBodyGyro-std()-Y"
[29,] "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z"          "fBodyGyro-std()-Z"
[30,] "fBodyAccMag-mean()"          "fBodyAccMag-std()"
[31,] "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()"  "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()"
[32,] "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()"     "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()"
[33,] "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"

In addition, there are additional variables,
1. "Activity" - a description of the activity the subject was performing for the reading.
   Values are:
   WALKING
   WALKING_UPSTAIRS
   WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
   SITTING
   STANDING
   LAYING
   The dataset is using the string (e.g "LAYING" instead of originally : 6) representation
   per the steps requested in the exercise definition.
2. "Subject" - an integer value between 1 and 30 representing the subject of the
  readings.

There are 2 datasets provided. The first meets the steps of the course assignment.
In the second, the first data set was refined such that each measurement is a separate
observation:
1. averaged_by_action_by_subject.rds - Table with 68 columns and 180 (30 x 6 activities) rows.
   Each row includes Activity and Subject identifiers and 66 values of the averages
   of the measurements for each variable.
2. averaged_by_action_by_subject_by_signal.rds" - A collection of tables where Each
   table holds that data for one measurement for every action and subject. E.g
   Body Gyro data for Walking by customer.

2. How to use
  ++++++++++++
  1. Clone the repository and set working directory to the root of the repository.
  2. Data files above are under ./merged
  3. read the files into R using readRDS(filename)
